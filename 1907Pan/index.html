        <h1 class="title">The Honda PanEuropean</h1>
        <p>The Honda ST series, also known as the <strong>Pan-European</strong> in Europe, is a duo of Sport Touring motorcycles comprising the ST1100 and the later ST1300</p>
        <p>Following the launch of the Gold Wing, which was very successful in the US, Honda's marketing team perceived that the European market (hence the "Pan European" moniker) would appreciate a lighter, sportier, and more manoeuvrable motorcycle. Introduced in 1990, the ST1100 was given a water-cooled 90-degree V4 engine mounted inline, instead of a flat-four engine (as in the Gold Wing). The ST1100 gained most of the Gold Wing's other characteristic engineering elements, such as shaft drive, a full fairing and integral panniers. Introduced to the European market a year before it was available in the United States, the ST1100 supplied within a sportier package the features required by touring riders, thereby filling a niche between the Honda VFR750F sports tourer and the larger Gold Wing.</p>

                <p>The ST1100 had a 1,085 cc longitudinal 90-degree V4 engine. The fuel tank was located below the saddle (the tank at the usual location is actually the cover for the air filter) to lower the center of gravity and thus improve the handling.</p></div>

                <p> It was manufactured by Honda between 1990 and 2002. A police variant, the ST1100P, was available for several more years.Weighing around 290kg, the ST1100 was no lightweight.</p></div>

                <p>The bike was fitted with wing-shaped tipover protectors projecting from the side of the lower part of the fairing. These would not only protect the bike and cylinder heads in a crash.</p></div>

            <h1 class="title2">Long Distance Runs</h1>
            <p>The ST1100 was optimized for long-distance touring with the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A longitudinal V-4 engine layout with low maintenance shaft drive.</li>
                <li>Optional antilock brakes (ABS) and traction control system (TCS). ABS model years from 1992 through 1995 have conventional separate front and rear braking systems. After 1996, ABS-equipped bikes have front-rear linked brakes (LBS).</li>
                <li>An exceptionally large 28 l (7.4 US gallon) fuel tank, giving a range of about 300 highway miles (480 km).</li>
                <li>A large 40 amp, air-cooled alternator to power multiple accessories such as auxiliary lighting and electrically heated clothing (Early models had a problematic 28 amp alternator which could be upgraded to the 40 amp version).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Weighing around 290kg, the ST1100 was no lightweight. The bike was fitted with wing-shaped tipover protectors projecting from the side of the lower part of the fairing.[10] These would not only protect the bike and cylinder heads in a crash, but, should the rider drop the bike on its side, would prevent this very heavy bike from leaning over so far that it would be nigh impossible to pick up again; the panniers also helped in this matter. The ST1100 low-mounted rear-view mirrors were particularly effective.</p>
